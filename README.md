### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Hannah Dinh and I am currently pursuing a degree in Computer Science at UC Santa Cruz.
Previously, I studied at Santa Clara University for my first year, transferred to De Anza College and studied there for my second year, then transferred to UCSC. I also took a couple classes at Footill College while I was at De Anza.
